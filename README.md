# Deep-Learning

Advanced Machine Learning course

This is my github repository for Deep Learning:

    * I try to cover the fundamentals of Deep Learning, from the basic ideas of overfitting and underfitting to state of the art CNN and RNN.

    * My final project consist in designing a captioning neural network, featuring both a CNN for feature extraction (Pretrained InceptionV3) and an RNN. It is trained on a set of (images, captions) and the network learns to caption any image (that resembles the training set, that is)
